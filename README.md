# StrainMetaSim

This repository contains scripts and downloads to data necessary to recreate the `complex strain' in silico mock community from Quince et al "DESMAN: a new tool to decipher strain-level divergence de novo from metagenomes".

1. Lets create a directory for working in and set PATH to scripts:
```
    mkdir ComplexStrainSim
    cd ComplexStrainSim
    export METASIMPATH=/MyPath/StrainMetaSim/scripts
```
 

2. Then download the processed data for 100 species with multiple strains obtained from the NCBI.

```
    wget https://complexstrainsim.s3.climb.ac.uk/Strains.tar.gz
```

2. Extract out species directories:
```
    tar -xvzf Strains.tar.gz
```
